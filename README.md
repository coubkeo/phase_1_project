#Overview

 This To Do app was created to keep track of tasks and important dates.

 The world today is continually growing, yet there never seems to be enough hours in a day to do it all. To combat daily chaos this To Do app assists with organizing tasks. 

Features

   - The input box allows the user to add their own personalized tasks and goals.
   - The calander button adds the date the task is started 
   - The check mark button adds the date the task was completed and crosses out the task.

 The list helps visualize the priority of each task and the dates help track the amount of time each task takes to complete. Seeing these elements can help with completing more tasks and assist in time management skills.

Road Map
 In the future, I would like to elevate the app to allow the user to prioritize tasks and set a due date that would allow for reminders so the tasks to be completed in a timely manner.
